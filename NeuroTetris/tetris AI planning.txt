1. 
	* Sum of all column heights
    * Sum of absolute column differences
    * Maximum height on the board
    * Number of holes on the board
2. Calculate score for every position and rotation. Do the one with best score based on:
	Hole count
	Bumpiness
	Lines Cleared

My hypothesis:
	inputs (400 nodes):
	the grid of cells and if they are used
	the grid of cells of last update and if they are used

	hidden:
	ummm what about 100 nodes

	output:
	one hot vector on which move to do with these options:
	[
		left
		right
		down
		rotate left
		rotate right
	]
