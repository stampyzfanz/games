## This file's goal

To put into writing what I want to do with this game so that I don't overengineer it and my plan is clear and straightforward

## Gameplan for NeuroTetris
- [x] Measure aggregate height (Sum of all column heights)
- [x] Measure complete lines
- [x] Measure holes
- [x] Measure bumpiness
- [] Use takes these measurements for every orientation of every position of the tetromino.
- [] Times these values by weights determined by GA
- [] Try to visualise it somehow

## Goals
- [x] Remove NN code
- [] Do algorithms for the measurements
- [] Make GA
