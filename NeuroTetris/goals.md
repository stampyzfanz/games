# Goals
## This file's goal

To put into writing what I want to do with this game so that I don't overengineer it and my plan is clear and straightforward

## Gameplan for NeuroTetris
- [] Measure aggregate height (Sum of all column heights)
- [] Measure complete lines
- [] Measure holes
- [] Measure bumpiness
- [] Use takes these measurements for every orientation of every position of the tetromino.
- [] Times these values by weights determined by GA
- [] Try to visualise it somehow

## Goals
- [x] Remove NN code
- [] Do algorithms for the measurements
- [] Make GA
